This is a fix for the Steam version of 1931: Scheherazade at the Library of Pergamum. There is a naming issue with the following Steam achievements:

Bonded with Anna
Bonded with Aunt Evelyn
Bonded with Felix
Bonded with Nigel
Bonded with Roland
Bonded with Sterling

that prevented the achievement from being awarded even if you had the requirements fulfilled. This fix corrects the name of the achievement being awarded to the correct name.
